# gh-dxp

A gh client extension brought to you by Elhub's DevXP team.

## Thoughts

* Have a .devxp file (YAML) in repo that we can read config details from
  * Linters to use
* Nice to have:
  * new:  Create a new project with default template files.
  * work: Create a new local branch, switch to it. If already created, switch to branch
  * diff: Lint, Unit Test and Create a pull request from the existing branch with default info
  * land: Squash-merge a pull request, switch back to default branch
  * lint: Run linters on project
  * unit: Run unit tests
* Dreams:
  * Proper Jira integration. Do some basic Jira checks (is ticket assigned, put into progress, etc).
